After the update from the previous edit, I looked a bit about the connection between client and server and I found out that even when mongod.exe was not running, there was still something listening on port 27017 with netstat -a

So I tried to launch the server with a random port using

[dir]mongod.exe --port 2000
Then the shell with

[dir]mongo.exe --port 2000
And this time, the server printed a message saying there is a new connection. I typed few commands and everything was working perfectly fine, I started the basic tutorial from the documentation to check if it was ok and for now it is.

Thanks spent too much time on this. On windows 10 message queuing seems to be enabled mqsvc.exe which was using port 27017. â€“ dan Jun 1 '17 at 20:10

You should have started the mongod instance with access control, i.e., the --auth command line option, such as:

$ mongod --auth
Let's start the mongo shell, and create an administrator in the admin database:

$ mongo
> use admin
> db.createUser(
  {
    user: "myUserAdmin",
    pwd: "abc123",
    roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
  }
)
Now if you run command "db.stats()", or "show users", you will get error "not authorized on admin to execute command..."

> db.stats()
{
        "ok" : 0,
        "errmsg" : "not authorized on admin to execute command { dbstats: 1.0, scale: undefined }",
        "code" : 13,
        "codeName" : "Unauthorized"
}
The reason is that you still have not granted role "read" or "readWrite" to user myUserAdmin. You can do it as below:

> db.auth("myUserAdmin", "abc123")
> db.grantRolesToUser("myUserAdmin", [ { role: "read", db: "admin" } ])
Now You can verify it (Command "show users" now works):

> show users
{
        "_id" : "admin.myUserAdmin",
        "user" : "myUserAdmin",
        "db" : "admin",
        "roles" : [
                {
                        "role" : "read",
                        "db" : "admin"
                },
                {
                        "role" : "userAdminAnyDatabase",
                        "db" : "admin"
                }
        ]
}
Now if you run "db.stats()", you'll also be OK:

> db.stats()
{
        "db" : "admin",
        "collections" : 2,
        "views" : 0,
        "objects" : 3,
        "avgObjSize" : 151,
        "dataSize" : 453,
        "storageSize" : 65536,
        "numExtents" : 0,
        "indexes" : 3,
        "indexSize" : 81920,
        "ok" : 1
}
This user and role mechanism can be applied to any other databases in MongoDB as well, in addition to the admin database.

(MongoDB version 3.4.3)
